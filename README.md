# ðŸš— Smart_CarParking_Detection
A Python-based Car parking space detection system that uses computer vision to monitor parking lot occupancy in real-time. 
Built with OpenCV and CvZone, it identifies free and occupied parking spots from a video feed or image, making it ideal for smart parking management solutions.
# Features
1.) Detects and highlights occupied and free parking spaces.

2.) Displays the number of available spots dynamically.

3.) Supports interactive setup to define parking spot positions on an image.

4.) Uses adaptive thresholding and contour analysis for robust detection.
